# Carlos-El-Robot
This repo contains the Java methods and projects I’ve worked on in my OOP classes at college. The focus is on exercises with "Carlos el Robot," a program that helps students learn OOP. In this repo, you'll find methods and solutions I’ve implemented while working on assignments, exploring topics like inheritance and encapsulation.

In this project, I use the Carlos el Robot 2.0 program. You can download it and learn more from the original repository
